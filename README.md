GearUp is a sports equipment rental web application designed to help users rent a variety of sports equipment, including skis, snowboards, skates, and more. The platform allows users to log in, personalize their accounts with key details such as height, weight, and experience level, and receive tailored recommendations for the most suitable equipment available for rent.
